# Fixing Deployment Issue on Google Cloud Platform

## Issue
The deployment failed due to the service account not having access to the specified Google Cloud Storage bucket.

## Steps to Resolve

1. **Check if the Bucket Exists:**
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser).
   - Look for the bucket named `staging.mywebsite-hosting.appspot.com`.

2. **Grant Permissions to the Service Account:**
   - If the bucket exists, click on it to open the bucket details.
   - Click on the "Permissions" tab.
   - Click on "Add" to grant permissions.
   - In the "New members" field, enter the service account email: `mywebsite-hosting@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`.
   - In the "Select a role" dropdown, choose "Storage Object Admin" or "Storage Admin" to provide the necessary access.
   - Click "Save" to apply the changes.

3. **Retry Deployment:**
   - After granting the necessary permissions, try deploying the application again using:
     ```bash
     gcloud app deploy
     ```

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project.
- If the bucket does not exist, you may need to create it or check your project settings.

For more information, refer to the [Google Cloud Storage documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs).
