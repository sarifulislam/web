# Deployment Guide for Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

## Prerequisites
- Ensure you have the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) installed on your local machine.
- Make sure you have a Google Cloud account and a project created in the Google Cloud Console.

## Steps to Deploy

1. **Authenticate with Google Cloud:**
   Open your terminal and run the following command to log in:
   ```bash
   gcloud auth login
   ```

2. **Set the Project ID:**
   Set the project ID for the GCP project where you want to deploy your application:
   ```bash
   gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
   ```

3. **Deploy the Application:**
   Navigate to the directory containing your `app.yaml` file and run the following command:
   ```bash
   gcloud app deploy
   ```

4. **Access Your Application:**
   After the deployment is complete, you can access your application at:
   ```
   https://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com
   ```

## Additional Notes
- Make sure your `app.yaml` file is correctly configured for your application.
- You may need to enable billing for your GCP project to deploy applications.
